    If tomorrow is judgment day
    And I'm standing on the front line
    And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
    I will say I spent it with you
    If I wake up in World War III (World War III)
    I see destruction and poverty
    And I feel like I want to go home
    It's okay if you're coming with me


    'Cause your love is my love
    And my love is your love
    It would take an eternity to break us
    And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
    'Cause your love is my love
    And my love is your love
    It would take an eternity to break us

        
    And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us               
    If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
    And I'm homeless on the street (on the street oh Lord)
    And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)                   
    It's okay if you're sleeping with me
    As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
    We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
    And no matter how old we get
    It's okay as long as I got you baby
    'Cause your love is my love


    And my love is your love
    It would take an eternity to break us
    And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
    'Cause your love is my love
    And my love is your love
    It would take an eternity to break us
    And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
    If I should die this very day (very very very day)


    Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
    And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
    I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
    'Cause your love is my love
    And my love is your love


    It would take an eternity to break us
    And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
    'Cause your love is my love
    And my love is your love
    It would take an eternity to break us
    And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
